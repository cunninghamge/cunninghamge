### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Back End developer with a passion for helping others and developing new skills. I have a background in non-profit work and am excited to use code to do some good in the world. I'm currently a student at the Turing School of Software & Design, where I've focused thusfar on building both full-stack and back end Rails apps; next up I'll be diving into microservices and adding JavaScript on the front end. I'm looking for work and open to collaboration opportunities. You can find me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/grayson-cunningham) or check out my [resume](https://resume.creddle.io/resume/czokbysnwon).
