### Hi, I'm Gus!

I'm a backend developer with a background in non-profit work. I enjoy building APIs, writing All The Tests, and going down research rabbit holes to learn how my favorite workflow tools and RubyGems work.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby, Rails, SQL, Bash scripting
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any interesting web apps or CLI tools
